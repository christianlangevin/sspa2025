# SSPA 2025 Boulder Workshop

Welcome to the 2-day Python/FloPy/MODFLOW workshop!

## Overview
This workshop will introduce groundwater modeling with MODFLOW using Python and FloPy. Participants will:
- Learn the basics of MODFLOW and FloPy
- Work through hands-on exercises and examples
- Use Jupyter notebooks for interactive modeling

## Software

We will be using a conda environment to run Python.  The instructions for installing a conda environment (using Miniforge) for this workshop are located on the [software page](./SOFTWARE.md).

In addition to Python, you may also want to install

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com) (optional -- good for source control)
- A text editor of your choice, such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).
- QGIS or ArcGIS
